## FAQ

### Why Common Lisp?
Everybody makes mistakes. This project made me realize the importance of a programming language's ecosystem when working on real-world projects (I had never written in Common Lisp prior to this project).

### Why is Ankilab defunct?
Ankilab became defunct after a software update on the server hosting the website.
