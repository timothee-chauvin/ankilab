# About AnkiLab

AnkiLab is an unofficial platform to share [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) cards and decks.

Contrary to [Ankiweb shared decks](https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/), it displays all cards directly in the browser. It also features better tagging and filtering capabilities.

The idea is that not all Anki cards should be hidden inside decks, and only revealed after someone has downloaded an entire deck into their collection.

With AnkiLab, cards can also be shared to:

- people looking for inspiration to write their own cards;
- people curious to see how others formulate their questions and answers;
- people who haven't necessarily downloaded Anki (yet).
